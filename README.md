  <strong>Ease collaboration without having your worlds collide</strong><br>
  As developers, we know that acting programatically on events within an organization can be hard, but between organizations are even harder. With the isolation model that Github offers (which is awesome from a security perspective) it often hampers collaboration capabilities between disjointed teams or organizations - on a Github level. With Zekt - customers can overcome these roadblocks - by having Zekt act as the trusted broker of events & messaging - occuring on one side of the organization (or repository) - feeding them to their intended consumers sitting within another Github organization.

### 🧭 About Us
**Zekt.dev** is redefining how teams interact with each other or their customers without having to create complex API frameworks or plumbing infrastructure in between companies. Zekt will with your consent (using Github app) gather meta-data on assigned repositories and feed that meta-data (and custom messages) to your desired customers - which they can then act upon!
We leverage your **federated GitHub Identity)** and **Zekt Github Apps** to enable collaboration capabilities between intended targeted customers of those events.

Our vision: **“Collaborate through zekt - using github workflows across organizations”**
